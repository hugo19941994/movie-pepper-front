    <p>This is a movie recommendation website which implements an LSA and Doc2Vec based models to recommend movies.</p>
    <p>All the code and research is open source with an MIT License. Please take a look at the repos to find more info.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, I cannot distribute the datasets used to train both models. However, there is a spider written with Spidy in oure backend repo to download similar data from IMdB.</p>
    <p>The website was built using VueJS2 with Nuxt for Server Side Rendering</p>
